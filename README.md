# Pablo's Dad's Patience

A single player card game built using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: Vue

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

**Production Demo**: [Heruko App](https://kennys-patience.herokuapp.com/)

I built PDP for a friend. His dad taught him the game when he was kid and I thought it would be fun to code it. The physical card game is as annoying as it is addictive. The app might just be annoying :)

# Rules

Player starts with a full deck of cards. They must turn over each card while calling out numbers from 1 to 13 in order. 1,2,3,4,5..... They must repeat this number sequence until all cards are turned.

If the player's call matches the numerical value of the turned card - THEY LOSE!

If the player successfully turns over every card - THEY WIN!

**Card Values**

- Ace : 1
- 2..10 : 2..10
- Jack : 11
- Queen : 12
- King : 13
